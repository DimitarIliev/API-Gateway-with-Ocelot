#Microservices Architecture 
The adoption of microservices architecture, which was developed to solve the monolithic architecture limitations, is a big trend in the software industry.

A microservices based application may have many microservices, from 10 to 100 to 1000, each having their own entry point. 

By using an API Gateway, we can provide one unified entry point to the whole system. 

#API Gateway with Ocelot 
Ocelot is an open-source, scalable and fast API Gateway designed for .NET Core in combination with a microservices architecture.
